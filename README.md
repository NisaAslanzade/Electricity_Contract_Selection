# Electricity Contract Selection Project Repository

Introduction:
Just over a year ago, I had a smart electricity meter installed at my home. This particular model of smart meter reports usage to the electricity provider every hour. Now, my electricity contract is due for renewal, and as a financial analyst, I aim to identify the contract that will minimize my annual electricity cost.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze my electricity usage data and compare the costs under three different types of electricity contracts: No Flex, Monthly Flex, and Hourly Flex. By leveraging historical usage data and contract specifics, I aim to determine the optimal contract that aligns with my usage patterns and minimizes costs.

Methodology:
- Data Collection: Obtain historical electricity usage data from the "Usage" sheet in the provided workbook.
- Data Cleaning: Clean up the data to ensure it is properly structured and sorted. This involves organizing the data by date and hour.
- Analysis: Calculate the total annual cost under each contract type using the respective pricing structures. For "No Flex," the cost per kWh remains constant throughout the year. For "Monthly Flex," the cost per kWh varies by month. For "Hourly Flex," the cost per kWh fluctuates based on the time of day.
- Contract Comparison: Compare the total annual costs under each contract type to determine the most cost-effective option.

Repository Structure:
- Data: Contains raw and cleaned-up usage data.
- Analysis: Includes scripts for data cleaning and analysis.
- Results: Stores the output of the analysis, including cost comparisons.
- Documentation: Contains project documentation, including the README file.

Conclusion:
By conducting a thorough analysis of my electricity usage and comparing it against the three available contract options, I aim to make an informed decision that minimizes my annual electricity costs. This project will not only benefit me but also serves as a demonstration of data analysis skills and decision-making capability for similar scenarios.
